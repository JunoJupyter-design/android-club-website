Android Club Promotional Website
This repository contains the source code for a modern, fully responsive promotional website for the "Android Club." It is built with clean, semantic HTML5, modern CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, following best practices for web development.

The primary goal of this project is to create an engaging and visually appealing landing page to attract new members, showcase club activities, and provide essential information.

Features
Fully Responsive Design: A mobile-first approach ensures the website looks and functions beautifully on all devices, from smartphones to large desktop screens.

Modern & Engaging UI: A sleek dark theme with vibrant, tech-inspired colour accents (#FFC107 Amber & #00B4D8 Teal) creates a professional and inviting aesthetic.

Dynamic Animations & Transitions:

Smooth scrolling for all navigation links.

Active navigation link highlighting that follows the user's scroll position.

Subtle hover effects on buttons, cards, and links to provide satisfying user feedback.

On-scroll fade-in animations for project cards, powered by the Intersection Observer API.

Clean & Organized Code: The project is structured with separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to read, maintain, and scale. The CSS is well-commented and organized with a clear variable system.

Zero Dependencies: Built purely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No build tools or external libraries (other than Font Awesome for icons) are required to run the project.

Tech Stack
HTML5: For the core structure and content.

CSS3: For all styling, layout, and animations. Uses modern features like CSS Variables, Flexbox, Grid, and clamp() for fluid typography.

Vanilla JavaScript: For all interactive features, including smooth scrolling, scroll-based animations, and dynamic content updates.
